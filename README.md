## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

**b. Include a video of your working video doorbell**

## Part C. Make it your own

**a. Find, install, and try out a node-based library and try to incorporate into your lab. Document your successes and failures (totally okay!) for your writeup. This will help others in class figure out cool new tools and capabilities.**

In my implementation, I installed the jimp package. With this package, I was able to read and load the image that was captured and modify it so that I could imnprove the quality of the picture while making the picture better and including a greyscale filter to this picture.

**b. Upload a video of your working modified project**
